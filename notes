Workshops:

  ** Talk about modeling different parallel algorithms.
  ** Write a thread-safe std::queue that can be waited on for presence of data
  ** Write a small transcoder, get the student to make it parallel with C/C++11
  ** Improve it using Intel TBB
  ** Demonstration/exercices on all the debug/performance tools with large sessions on
  *** gdb
  *** perf
  ** Advanced: Write a correct and fully lock-free queue
